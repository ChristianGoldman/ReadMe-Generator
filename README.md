## My story
* Project enabled me to better understand string interpolation
* I no longer have to manually build my ReadMe I can utilize the generator
## Features ##
* Users are able to list the description in the ReadMe in one big paragraph or seperate key points using bullet points
* A badge displaying various license will appear at the top of the page
* A table of contents that will take you to the corresponding location on the readme
* A corresponding notice to the license you have chosen will appear at the bottom of the ReadMe
## Installation ##
1. Open up git bash terminal
2. Change directory to desired location (%User Profile%/SourceRepo)
3. Clone the repository (git clone git@github.com:ChristianGoldman/ReadMe-Generator.git)
